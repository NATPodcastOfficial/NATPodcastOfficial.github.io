                    <b>⚠ WARNING: </b> Server rules are expected to be updated in every revamp that the server goes through 
                    which can be every two months. Please go to our Discord Page to view more information. Rules will be updated
                    on the website before the initial revamp (15 - 30 minutes before or even at such times like 1 day before initial rules are set).
                    But due to GitHub Pages Hosting Delay, it will take about 2 to 10 minutes for changes to be visible.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    In the information below, you will find a <b>Purpose</b> section that explains why we need such rules, then below that is the 
                    <b>Preface</b> section. In this section, you will find the introduction to the rules and a few things to keep in mind because they are common sense.
                    And then you have your <b>Server Rules</b>. If you have any questions about our server rules, please email us or text one of our server administrators/moderators for assistance.

                    <p class="textInfo">
                        In <b>Not Atomically Thinking</b>, it is our mission to keep everyone in the server safe and welcoming for everyone. On a few occasions,
                        people might join just to threaten server members using hate speech, racisim (racist slurs, etc.) and then just leave the server 
                        as if that nothing will happen to them. But thanks to our highly trained moderators, administrators, head of staff and supervisors,
                        they have trained for this moment and for anyone who does such an act, their punishment will be given to them accordingly, so that you
                        may have a valuable experience at our server. In the <b>Rules</b> section, it will outline most of the "what to do and what not to do",
                        in the Discord Server. We incorage that everyone reads the rules so that they can protect themselves and so they can know what is right,
                        and what is wrong.
                    </p>

                    <p class="textInfo textPreface">
                        <b>⚠ Remember:</b> All rules in the server apply at all times and in all places. Most of the time, broken rules result in a warning - these expire with time 
                        and add up to punishments such as a mute or ban. Certain rules that are broken may come with an immediate ban or a permanent ban.

                        <br>

                        Propagating or influencing those that have broken the rules may result in punishment. This includes attempting to bait people into admitting they're under 13, 
                        trying to make people spam ping you through a nickname, or quoting/replying to rule-breaking messages. Basically, trying people to admit the wrong when they are 
                        innocent.

                        will be permanently banned from the server with no way of getting back in. This type of ban is unappealable.

                        <br>

                        • If you see something against the rules or something that makes you feel unsafe, let staff know.

We want this server to be a welcoming space! • Please keep your Discord Username in English or have it contain with no characters that are not on the US Keyboard
